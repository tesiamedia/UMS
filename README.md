# UMS
Universal Management System - Universal core for any CMS, CRM or similar application

In 2007 an idea of a better CMS was born in our minds. 
The very first steps were extreemely difficult, making everything from scratch and with a huge lack of experience. 
Version 2.0 of TesiaManager CMS was released on 2008 and since then being partialy rewritten every two years. 
Last year's production version (5.0) was the final and is incappable to grow anymore due to difficult non-centered structure. 

Today we are developing something on a bigger scale. 
A system that should be so flexible yet fast, to be used on any web based php application. 
So starting at the basics of objective logics we beggin with core classes and versatile methods. 

Here at GitHub we publish the Lite version of UMS, which will be released as an open source project soon. You can use the logics and functions freely. Later your contributions will be very welcomed, but for now many classes have to be expanded and fixed. 
First milestone is a new template engine.
