Universal Management System - Universal core for any CMS, CRM or similar application

In 2007 an idea of a better CMS was born in our minds. 
The very first steps were extreemly difficult, making everything from scratch. 
Version 2.0 of TesiaManager CMS was released on 2008 and since then being partialy rewritten every two years. 
Last year's production version (5.0) was final and was incappable to grow anymore due to lack of OOP and unified core. 

Today we are developing something on a bigger scale. 
A system that should be so flexible yet fast, to be used on any web based php application. 
So starting at the basics of objective logics we beggin with core classes and versatile methods. 

More information coming soon...
